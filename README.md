# WQSG_UMD_kkMod
WQSG_UMD_kkMod (v0.1b) is a fork of [WQSG_UMD](https://github.com/WQSG/WQSG_UMD), a free and open source UMD archive manager with intuitive and clean interface, a replacement to UMDGen, developed by 恶梦的死神, Kid and 腾袭. The kkMod fork will include [WQSG_Lib](https://github.com/WQSG/WQSG_Lib) and will add more command line tools to the already existing command line mode of WQSG_UMD, all source files will be converted to a more compiler-friendly format: Chinese comments will be translated to English, strings using Chinese caracters will be replaced with A-Za-z0-9 strings and the file encoding will be converted to UTF-8.BOM.DOS for improved portability.

**Note** - The current code (as of 2017-04-15) is unaltered since 2014 and the program was reported to have issues with Windows 10. I'll be editing the files locally and the repository will be updated gradually during the next days.
