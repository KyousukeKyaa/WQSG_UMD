# WQSG_UMD_kkMod
WQSG_UMD_kkMod (v0.1b) is a fork of [WQSG_UMD](https://github.com/WQSG/WQSG_UMD), a free and open source UMD archive manager with intuitive and clean interface, a replacement to UMDGen, developed by 恶梦的死神, Kid and 腾袭. The kkMod fork will include WQSG_Lib and will add more command line tools to the already existing command line mode of WQSG_UMD, all source files will be converted to a more compiler-friendly format: Chinese comments will be translated to English, strings using Chinese caracters will be replaced with A-Za-z0-9 strings and the file encoding will be converted to UTF-8.BOM.DOS for improved portability.

**Note** - The current code (as of 2014-04-14) is unaltered, I'm editing the files locally and the repository will gradually be updated during the next days.
